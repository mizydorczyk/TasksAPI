# TasksAPI
The app enables the registration and login of users, who can then create, mark as done, tasks within the created groups. Furthermore, the creator of a group as its owner can generate an invitation code and invite others to join their task group.

Details and possible actions can be found in the ``/docs`` folder.

## Setup
- Adjust ``appsettings.json`` and ``TasksAPI/Dockerfile`` (optional)
- Run ``docker-compose up`` in terminal.
